Allow your customers to create configurable products with a live preview of the result. Works using a system of layers.

== Description ==

The Product Configurator for WooCommerce allows you to use layers to produce instant visuals for your customers.

Give your customers a great experience, and make your life easy: no need to create many product variations with their images. 

Instead, export your layers from Photoshop, a 3D render, or an other source, and allow the user to configure their product using those.
